This app creates ASCII-art from given picture and show it in special textbox.

This project doesn't have any unit tests, because it creates visual representation of an image, using ASCII symbols. I can't be sure, if generated output fully matches given picture, with some kind of mathematical accuracy, and i can't create expected ascii-output for testing in other way, than with the same app. In that case, testing would be useless.Other functions are very simple, and, in my opinion, using Unit tests here would be redundant.
