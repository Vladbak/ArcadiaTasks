Word Search Solver app gets matrix of letters and set of words, returns matrix with highlighted found words
	
You can run it with that IDE. If you want to run Unit tests, in Visual Studio Menu, 
 open Test->Windows->Test Explorer. You'll see new window, but without tests. Then you have to build 
 VS solution (Ctrl+Shift+B), so Test Explorer window can recognise my test functions. After that, you can run 
 any test you want, or all together.
