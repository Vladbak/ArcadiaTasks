If you want to run Unit tests, in Visual Studio Menu, 
 open Test->Windows->Test Explorer. You'll see new window, but without tests. Then you have to build 
 VS solution (Ctrl+Shift+B), so Test Explorer window can recognise my test functions. After that, you can run 
 any test you want, or all together.
