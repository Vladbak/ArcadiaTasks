# ArcadiaTasks
Repository contains solutions for programmer tasks from Arcadia
	
	All task solutions are written in C#, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

ParsingMp3Tags gets paths to mp3 files as commandline arguments and output all found tag information
	
	You can run it with that IDE. If you want to run Unit tests, in Visual Studio Menu, 
 open Test->Windows->Test Explorer. You'll see new window, but without tests. Then you have to build 
 VS solution (Ctrl+Shift+B), so Test Explorer window can recognise my test functions. After that, you can run 
 any test you want, or all together.
